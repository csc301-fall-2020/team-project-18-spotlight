## Process - Reflection

### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

Throughout the process, a lot of decisions have been made to both suit the client’s and developer’s needs. To increase the efficiency of our development process, we decided to streamline our process flow of communication both between developers and clients.

1. One of the most important decisions we made is to assign different roles to the team. Our team split the app’s pages into three groups, then assigned one front end and one back end team member to each section. This way, most of the team’s work would not interfere with each other, leading to less merge conflicts as our app progressed. Having a front end and a back end member working on each part of the app also ensured that the data-side and UI-side of each page received equal amounts of attention for a more consistent product.

2. In terms of git workflow, we discovered that Github pull requests and issues are really useful tools for being productive and fixing merge conflicts. Github issues allowed us to keep track of ongoing feature-requests/bug fixes without using a third-party organizational solution. While something like Trello would certainly have more robust task management features, we found that Github issues were good enough.
By creating a branch for each feature/bugfix, we were able to take advantage of Github Actions to run linting on each pull request. This was an intuitive way for us to track changes and deal with conflicts, because each branch corresponds to one particular feature.

### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Initially, we divided the team in 2 groups of 3 persons (1 for frontend and 1 for backend). However, we later realised that we need a further division of the groups. This is due to the different screen pages with different functionality that our client requested. Also, with a lot of changes from the client-side, we need to have a system that allows developers to quickly make changes after every client meeting. As such, (as proposed above), we divided the team into 3 groups of 2, with each group having 1 member responsible for the frontend and the other responsible for the backend.

2. Previously, we expected that we would have to make more design decisions for our product than we did, when in fact our client already had a good idea of what they wanted. A couple times, our team would make a decision about how a part of the app would work or look, only to be told by our client that it did not fit their vision. We learned that it’s better to run more details by them before we start working to avoid having to undo/redo work, which is less time efficient.

### Q3. Planned changes

1. Since we are working in smaller teams that focus on specific features, we decided to stop using the trello/kanban board. We’ll focus our communications on updates on each pair’s individual work. We’re planning to use github issues / pull request comments instead to relay tasks and improvements to the work that we’ll do.

2. While originally we planned to have meetings every friday, we have decided that more is not necessarily better. Meetings are no good if we have nothing important to talk about, in which case they become a distraction and a waste of time. Instead, we will evaluate the need for meetings on a week-to-week basis.

## Product - Review

### Q4. How was your product demo?

For our demo, we loaded a development version onto Samuel’s iPhone, and the screen shared the app through a zoom meeting with our partner. In our demo, we showcased the authentication screen, the gym/map screen with mock data, a rudimentary calendar screen and a friends screen with mock data. We each took turns explaining the screens that we worked on. Alan and Patrick showed the authentication flow, ZengHao and Olivia showed the gym screen, and Samuel and Jennifer showed the calendar and friends screen.

Our partner was pleased with the results, and he gave a lot of input into the direction of the app design. He requested quite a few changes, including a whole new authentication/signup template that was different from our original design. He also requested a different color scheme to be used - a primary red/ secondary white color scheme compared to the primary white / secondary dark red color scheme.
We learnt that things can sometimes go wrong in the demo, and that when that happens the best thing to do is to stay calm and explain what’s going on. There might also be a lot of changes requested after a demo, and we need to be prepared to iteratively design and plan out the future design and functionality of the app.
